## Process Summary
1. Data acquisition & cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): key features/visuals
3. Advanced analysis: model / clustering / insights
4. Visualizations & findings

## Key Results & Insights
- The most common types of attacks were phishing and DDoS, This helps companies focus their training and security focuses on these two areas while maintaining against all other forms.
